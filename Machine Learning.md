*There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:
**[List](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp)**  is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
 **[Tuple](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples.asp)**  is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
 **[Set](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_sets.asp)**  is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
 **[Dictionary](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp)**  is a collection which is ordered and changeable. No duplicate members.

## Artificial Neural Network (ANN) & Nature Language Processing (NLP)

### ANN Basics
- [Introduction to tensors §](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/guide/tensor.ipynb#scrollTo=qFdPvlXBOdUN)
-- Is Numpy array a tensor? 
The distinction between a NumPy array and a tensor is that  **tensors, unlike NumPy arrays, are supported by accelerator memory such as the GPU, they have a faster processing speed**.

- [Unicode strings for NLP models §](https://www.tensorflow.org/text/guide/unicode)

- **Building  Layers and Models**
 [The Sequential model §](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/sequential_model)
 [Makinf new  layers and models via subclassing §](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/custom_layers_and_models)
 [Functional API § ](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/functional/)
-- The Keras _functional API_ is a way to create models that are more flexible than the [`tf.keras.Sequential`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Sequential) API. The functional API can handle models with non-linear topology, shared layers, and even multiple inputs or outputs. In general, the functional API is higher-level, easier and safer, and has a number of features that subclassed models do not support.
